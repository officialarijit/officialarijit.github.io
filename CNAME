# Custom domain for GitHub Pages
# Replace with your custom domain if you have one
# Example: yourname.com or www.yourname.com
# Leave this file empty or remove it if you don't have a custom domain

# To use a custom domain:
# 1. Replace this content with your domain (e.g., "yourname.com")
# 2. Add a CNAME record in your DNS provider pointing to yourusername.github.io
# 3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
